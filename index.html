        <h2>What Brought Me to Flatiron</h2>
            <p>I'm a former teacher of 6 years, and in the back of my mind, I always knew teaching wasn't for me. I quit the profession in 2021 and gave myself some time to figure out what I want in life. In that time, I tried a lot of new things; I dabbled in woodworking, got my personal training certification, and practiced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" >Codecademy</a>. I never thought I'd like coding, but it has been really nice to get into it, and I knew I needed to dive in. That's where I found <a href= "https://www.flatironschool.com" >Flatiron School</a>.</p>
